I am pleased to introduce you to Bjorn, a CyberViking that, once connected to the network (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or USB), will discover targets present on the network, find open ports, exposed services, and potential vulnerabilitiesâ€¦
With the help of Q-learning, he will learn to improve by performing scans or executing simple brute force or dictionary attacks (ssh, Telnet, SQL, etc.).
He will gain experience by discovering as many networks and hosts as possible, passwords, or exposed services.
He will have a memory of the networks to which he has already connected.
See you soon for future updates!


Features
Network Discovery: Automatically scans for devices and open ports on the network.
Vulnerability Detection: Identifies exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.
Q-learning: Utilizes Q-learning to improve scanning and attack techniques over time.
Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks: Performs simple brute force and dictionary attacks on common services (SSH, Telnet, SQL, etc.).
Experience Gaining: Gains experience by discovering new networks, hosts, passwords, and exposed services.
Network Memory: Remembers networks it has connected to previously for enhanced efficiency.


Prerequisites
A Raspberry Pi Zero
A Waveshare screen (2.13 inches V4 model in this example)
A microSD card with Raspberry Pi OS Lite installed
